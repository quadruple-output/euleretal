# Euleretal TODO list

## Bugs
- "Integrations" Pop-Up should be restricted to be placed inside its parent
  canvas
- Drop-Downs (Combo boxes) in "Integrations" Pop-Up are sometimes clipped away
- Description tool tips sometimes break text too early â†’ increase width

## UI features
- predefine list of colors which can be used as defaults for new Step Sizes or
  Integrators
- Button for auto-zoom
- render Integrator formulas in browser (KaTeX or MathJax)
- Dark and Light themes
- when zooming, zoom away from pointer, but not from center of canvas
- in lists with '+' button, put button at end of list (where the '-' button for
  the new entry will appear)
- in drop-downs/choosers, apply the chosen option immediately as preview on
  hover, without the need of clicking (design a new chooser for this)
- re-enable hover delay
- "Integrators" controls: show unused integrators separated from others, and
  collapsed
- add setting for `Inspector` to not scale velocities by dt (may be useful when
  comparing integrations with different step sizes)
- add option to (continuously) synchronize the view point of all canvases

## Functional Features
- change all step sizes proportionally with a single slider (to test convergence)
- interactively change scenario start conditions (velocity&direction)
- add more Integrators
- make canvas grid more flexible
- save&restore state automatically
- customizable Integrators
- save/load state in/from file

## Clean Code
- remove methods like `expected_accelerations_for_step` and determine
  "expected" values for next step from previous one.
