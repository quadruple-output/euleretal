## Overview

This is a graphical and interactive visualization tool for different discrete 
integration methods for physical rigid bodies (masses) accelerated in a force field.

The idea is to compare the precisions of different algorithms of the Euler and
Runge-Kutta family, and their suitability for different force fields.

This is work in progress, and in an early stage. You can [test the application online](https://quadruple-output.github.io/euleretal/).

Hint: Drag the graph with the mouse or zoom in/out by holding down the CTRL or CMD key and moving the mouse up/down.
