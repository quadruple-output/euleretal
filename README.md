## Overview

This is a graphical and interactive visualization tool for different discrete 
integration functions for physical rigid bodies (masses) accelerated in a force field.

The idea is to compare the precisions of different algorithms of the Euler and
Runge-Kutta family, and their suitability for different acceleration functions.
